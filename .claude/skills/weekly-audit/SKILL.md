# Skill: Weekly Business Audit

## Description
Conduct weekly audit of business metrics, tasks, and operations every Sunday to provide insights and recommendations.

## When to Use
- Scheduled every Sunday evening (automated via cron/Task Scheduler)
- On-demand when business review is needed
- End of month for monthly reporting
- Before planning next week's priorities

## Steps

### 1. Gather Weekly Data
```
Collect metrics from:
- /Done folder: Tasks completed this week
- /Logs folder: System activity logs
- Dashboard.md: Current status and stats
- Bank/financial files (if available)
- Calendar/schedule (if integrated)
```

### 2. Analyze Task Completion
```
Review completed tasks:
- Count tasks completed this week
- Categorize by type (email, LinkedIn, document, etc.)
- Identify patterns in completed work
- Note any incomplete or overdue tasks
```

### 3. Review Financial Activity
```
If financial data available:
- Revenue received this week
- Invoices sent
- Invoices paid
- Outstanding receivables
- Expenses tracked
```

### 4. Identify Bottlenecks
```
Look for:
- Tasks stuck in Needs_Action > 3 days
- Pending approvals not actioned
- Repeated task types (automation opportunity)
- Blocked dependencies
```

### 5. Audit Subscriptions & Tools
```
Review:
- Active subscriptions
- Tool usage (from logs)
- Unused services
- Cost optimization opportunities
```

### 6. Generate Proactive Suggestions
```
Based on analysis:
- Automation opportunities
- Process improvements
- Priority recommendations for next week
- Resource allocation suggestions
```

### 7. Create Weekly Audit Report
```
Location: /Briefings/WEEKLY_AUDIT_[YYYY-MM-DD].md

Use the Weekly Audit Template (see below)
```

### 8. Present to Human
```
- Save report in /Briefings
- Create Needs_Action file highlighting key items
- Update Dashboard with weekly stats
- Schedule review meeting if needed
```

## MCP Tools Used
- None directly - this is an analysis skill
- May use email_mcp to send audit summary
- May use other tools to gather data

## Approval Required
**NO** - Audit is informational only
**YES** - Any actions recommended require separate approval

## Integration with Daily Briefing
```
Weekly Audit complements Daily Briefing:
- Daily Briefing: Today's tasks and priorities
- Weekly Audit: Retrospective analysis and insights

Both reports should be consistent in metrics.
```

## Metrics Calculation

### Task Completion Rate
```
Completion Rate = (Tasks Completed / Tasks Detected) * 100
```

### Average Response Time
```
Avg Response = Sum(Response Times) / Number of Responses
```

### Week-over-Week Growth
```
Growth = ((This Week - Last Week) / Last Week) * 100
```
